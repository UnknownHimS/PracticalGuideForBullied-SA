    <h1 id="Title1Main">Bullying</h1>
    <div id="infoMain">
    
    
    <p>Bullying is when someone repeatedly hurts, threatens, or picks on another person on purpose. It can be physical (hitting or pushing), verbal (name-calling, teasing), or emotional (spreading rumors, excluding someone). It can also happen online, which is called cyberbullying.</p>
    
    </div>
    <div id="secondp">
        <p>Sometimes bullying happens when someone feels like they can’t do anything about it. Fear holds them back. Even if you think you could stand up to the person, you might feel frozen, your hands shake and your heart races. That’s totally normal; it means your body’s in fight or flight mode and the adrenaline can actually help you if you need it. So what should you do if you’re in that situation? Here are some practical tips: be smart and be brave. If you can’t fight physically, be brave enough to tell a trusted adult like your parents or authorities. And be smart by planning how to stop the bullying, but remember, it really depends on the situation.

    <h1>Tips if You Are Being Bullied</h1>
     <div id="secondpx">
        
           <p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Ask yourself why you feel scared.
Try to name the reasons you’re afraid: Are you outnumbered? Afraid adults won’t believe you? Ashamed? Understanding why you feel scared helps you decide what to do next.

Example: If you’re scared because the bullies are in a group and you’re usually alone, look for classmates or friends who can walk with you so you’re not isolated.</li>
                 <li>Get support and tell a trusted adult.
Adults sometimes don’t notice bullying unless it’s reported. Tell a parent, teacher, school counselor, or another adult you trust. Be specific: say who, when, and where the bullying happened.

Example: “On Monday at lunch, Sam and two others shoved my backpack and called me names. Here’s what happened.”</li>
                 <li>Gather evidence.
If it’s safe, keep a record of incidents  dates, times, what was said or done, and any witnesses. Screenshots or videos (if you or a witness can take them safely and legally) can help when you report the problem.

Example: Ask a friend to record an incident on their phone if you feel safe doing so  or write everything down as soon as you can after it happens.</li>
                  <li>Avoid risky situations and stay near others.
When possible, avoid places where bullying happens (or go with friends). Stay in public, well-lit areas and near adults or crowds.</li>
                  <li>Build allies and confidence.
Make friends, join clubs, or find groups where you feel accepted. Bullies are less likely to target someone who has friends and support. Practice confident body language: stand tall, make eye contact, and speak calmly.</li>
                  <li>Use safe, non-violent responses.
If a bully tries to provoke you, staying calm and not retaliating often reduces the situation. Saying something short and firm (“Stop. That’s not okay.”) and then walking away can be effective. If you feel physically threatened, get to a safe place and find an adult immediately.</li>       
                  <li>If the bullying continues, escalate the report.
If your first report doesn’t help, report the behavior again and bring your notes or evidence. Ask for specific actions from the school or authorities (e.g., supervision at certain times, mediation, or disciplinary steps). If the school doesn’t act, tell a parent so you can contact higher school administration or local authorities if necessary.</li>
                  <li>If you’re feeling ashamed or upset:
Talk to someone you trust about how it makes you feel a friend, family member, or counselor. You don’t have to handle this alone, and feeling ashamed doesn’t mean you did something wrong.
                        </li>
